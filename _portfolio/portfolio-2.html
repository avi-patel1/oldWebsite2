The project goal is to design, fabricate and test a small-scale dinosaur themed rollercoaster ride where a toy car rolls down a track and is picked up by a dinosaur's mouth and placed on the higher end of the track. 
I designed a 3 dof gripper arm to grab, rotate and lift the car from the lower to upper track using SolidWorks. The rotation of the arm was powered using Hi-Tec servo motors connected to an Arduino Uno. Initially, I computed the transmission torque for lifting the arm 90 degrees in seven seconds to get a baseline on the type of servos, weight of the arm and gripper, and toy car to use. It took me multiple prototypes until I was satisfied with the performance of the arm. The parts were 3D printed and assembled. I attached a light sensor to the lower jaw of the gripper to indicate when arm needs to lift the car to the higher track. Below, is a short video of the entire system.
