    <summary><b>Two-Stage Transmission (Design and Fabrication) - ME 14</b></summary>
    
    <p>
        The project goal is to analyze, design, and test a mechanical transmission to couple the output from a brushed DC motor to the system's output which is a bicycle wheel. 
        Working in a group of five, we designed and fabricated an acrylic gearbox enclosure which housed two pairs of spur gears. Here is the link to our 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JGZevNh5GYwK1V58hh1GVkri__8TguaK/edit#slide=id.p1" target="_blank">critical design review</a> 
        for a detailed description and CAD of the gearbox.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We selected a gear ratio that would optimize the maximum rotational speed of the wheel over the time it takes for the wheel to reach 250 rpm.
        We chose to add acrylic walls on top and bottom to dampen mechanical vibrations. During the fabrication stage of the project, 
        we used the end-mill for dimensioning the acrylic walls of the enclosure, tapping screw holes for fastening the walls together, 
        and drilling holes to press-fit ball bearings into. During our demonstration, we achieved a max rpm of 500 and it took 6.203 seconds for the system to reach 250 rpm.

    <summary><b> Classic Manipulators, Kinematics, Dynamics - CS/EE/ME 133a </b>
    </summary>
    <p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        The ME/EE/CS 133a course is the first in the core robotics sequence at Caltech focusing on kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems. 
        For our final project, we evaluated the performance of the Boston Dynamics Atlas robot cutting with the right hand and reaching 
        to grab an item on a neighboring shelf with the left. We approached this problem in two ways: First, we defined the cutting motion of the 
        right arm as the primary task and the left hand as the secondary task. Second, we defined both the right 
        and left hand tasks as primary tasks. We described our results including the tradeoffs between both approaches 
        in our final report and video.

    <summary><b> Planning, A*, PRM, Localization/Mapping - CS/EE/ME 133b </b>
    </summary>
    <p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
        The ME/EE/CS 133b course is the second in the core robotics sequence at Caltech focusing on algorithms for planning along with localization and mapping. 
        For our final project, we developed various planning algorithms for the ghosts to chase and capture Pac-Man. In the 
        first approach, we sequentially planned each ghost's path using A*. In the second approach, we create a region planner which using breadth-first search
        to identify potential locations where Pac-Man could arrive for the ghosts to target. In the last approach, we create a multi-dimensional planner where 
        each node in our graph contains the coordinates of all ghosts. We evaluated the performance of each approach and examined the trade-offs between them in
        our final report and video.

    <summary><b> Experimental Robotics - CS/EE/ME 129 </b>
    </summary>
    <p>
        <p> </p>
        I built a mobile, line and wall following robot as part of the CS/EE/ME 129 course at Caltech.
        The hardware includes three IR sensors for line following, end of road
        and intersection detection behaviors, a magnetometer board to measure the orientation 
        of the robot and three ultrasonic sensors to detect blockages in front and at the sides 
        of the robot.
        
        <img src="/images/129_Bot_rename.png" width="500" height="500" class="align-center"
        alt="Diagram">
        
        <p> </p>
        For the robot's software, I wrote the autonomous navigation algorithms, UI and mapping. 
        At every intersection, there are eight possible headings for the robot to explore. 
        Each heading (streets) is denoted by the following status colored on the map shown in the video below:
        
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color:black;"> Black</span>: existence of the street is unknown</li>
            <li> <span style="color:blue;"> Blue</span>: street exists but is unexplored</li>
            <li><span style="color:green;"> Green</span>: street is fully explored (connect to another intersection)</li>
            <li><span style="color:red;"> Red</span>: street has a dead end</li>
        </ul>
        I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal path to a goal node set by the user. 
        If the node is not on the current map, I implemented Dijkstra to the nearest nodes with unexplored headings
        while also exploring the map in the direction of the goal.
        Blockages are denoted by a red X on the map in the video below. The robot is able to replan around static blockages
        along with perform a panic u-turn on moving blockages. 

        Below is a demonstration of the robot where we run directed explore to some goal node.

    <summary><b> 2-DOF Gripper Arm (Design and Fabrication) - ME 14 </b>
    </summary>
    <p>
    The project goal is to design, fabricate and test a small-scale dinosaur themed rollercoaster ride where a toy car rolls down a track and is
    picked up by a dinosaur's mouth and placed on the higher end of the track. I designed a 3 dof gripper arm to grab, rotate and lift the car from the lower to upper track using SolidWorks. 
    The rotation of the arm was powered using Hi-Tec servo motors connected to an Arduino Uno. 
    Initially, I computed the transmission torque for lifting the arm 90 degrees in seven seconds to get a baseline on the type of servos, 
    weight of the arm and gripper, and toy car to use. It took me multiple prototypes until I was satisfied with the performance of the arm. 
    The parts were 3D printed and assembled. I attached a light sensor to the lower jaw of the gripper to indicate when arm needs to lift the 
    car to the higher track. Below is a demonstration of the system,
